### What is our Project about?
We have created a project to predict the flight fare of airlines to help the users to check for the best prices that may be available for a particular date in future.
We have used various algorithms like ExtraTreesRegressor and RandomForestRegressor. These algorithms are used to train our prediction model.
We have used Flask for our client-server interaction. The frontend is implemented with HTML and CSS.
