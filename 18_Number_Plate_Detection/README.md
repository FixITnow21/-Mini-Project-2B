### About & Purpose

Nowadays two-wheelers are the most popular modes of transport since all level of people can afford it. When the number of motorcyclist increases, there has 
been an increasing number of motorbike accidents due to reckless riding. The carelessness of motorcyclists not wearing a helmet is a predominant factor, and it 
commonly contributes to the bikerâ€™s head injury. To solve this issue, most countries have laws which mandate the use of helmets for two-wheeler riders.
In some countries, the government have installed a specialized sensor to check the presence of the helmet, but it is economically notreliable to buy 
sensors for every bike. Without a proper system, the traffic police personnel are deployed to check whether the motorcyclists are wearing the helmet or 
not. Automatic detection of LP for non-helmeted motorcyclist will help to reduce the burden faced by the traffic police, and it also need fewer human resources. 
As a result, the number of motorcyclists not wearing a helmet will get reduced.
