### What is our Project About?
We have built a Simple Plagiarisme Detection Syatem that check for similar Sentences or Phrases in a given File for Input Text. In this work, a paraphrase recognition approach has been used to detect the occurrence of plagiarism in source and suspicious passages. The project uses NLTK for Language Processing and finding the similar patterns in the input and the given dataset. At the end a Wordcloud is also Generated to shows the most repeated words in the Input text/File given by the User.
